 1. Detect repeated failed login attempts
index=main sourcetype=access_combined status=401 | stats count by src_ip | where count > 5

 2. Detect access to admin or sensitive endpoints
index=main "GET /admin" OR "GET /login"

 3. Top IPs by request volume (possible scanning)
index=main | stats count by src_ip | sort -count
