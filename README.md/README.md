#  Log Analysis for Intrusion Detection using Splunk

This project demonstrates how log data can be used to detect signs of intrusion using Splunkâ€™s powerful search capabilities. It focuses on unauthorized access attempts, brute-force login behavior, and sensitive endpoint access.

##  Objectives
- Ingest logs from a web server
- Analyze for suspicious patterns
- Simulate alerts for intrusion detection

##  Tools Used
- Splunk 
- Apache-style access logs

##  Folder Contents
- `sample_logs/webserver_logs.txt`: Example web server logs
- `splunk_queries_used.txt`: SPL queries used for detection
- `analysis_report.md`: Summary of findings and actions taken
